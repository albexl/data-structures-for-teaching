# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Implementations of some Data Structures, with different approaches and some
practical applications. Designed to be used as consulting material for those who want to learn about Data Structures and Algorithms and have a preference for the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.

Here is a checklist of the Data Structures and Algorithms we have or we are planning to add. If you would like to add more to the checklist, just create a Pull Request with your additions and we will review it.
